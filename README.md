<h1>Inspiration</h1>
<p>We wanted residents of delaware to meet new people and have better conversations with people in the great state of Delaware</p>

<h1>How does it work</h1>
<p>Conectify is a web app design to match people with each other based on similar interests and hobbies. This project was created with react.js, JavaScript and TypeScript with tailwind.css
for styling the website</p>

<h1>What we have learned and challenges</h1>
<p>We have learned a lot with taking a lot of risks, mapping components out and dealing with parsing for user profiles. Getting this done in 24 hours was difficult but
we had some diffulity rendering pictures for each profile and also getting the chat implementation as we ran out of time. For the future we should implementing the chatting feature</p1>
